# Dotfiles

A (semi-)automated setup of my macOS High Sierra environment.

## Big Fat Warning!

If you want to give this a try, you should first clone this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need.

Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. **Use at your own risk!**

## Install

To install run the script, like so:

```sh
./install.sh
